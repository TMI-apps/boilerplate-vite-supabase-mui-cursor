# stepback

Take a step back. Explain what problem we are solving and what route we've chosen to a solution. Also list the last couple of attempts and their outcome. Then reflect on a route that we might take if we'd step back even more and looked at the issue at large. Finally compare the pro's and cons of doing that, vs the other most fruitfull option.
