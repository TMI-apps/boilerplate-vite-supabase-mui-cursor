# prime

Load project context at the start of a new session. Build an understanding of this boilerplate’s structure, governance, and active state before tackling tasks.

**When to use:** New chat, ambiguous task, or before larger refactors.  
**Related:** For feature requests and completeness gates, use `.cursor/skills/check/SKILL.md`. For onboarding a human, use `.cursor/skills/start/SKILL.md`.

## Objective

Align with project rules and architecture so work does not violate enforced boundaries (ESLint boundaries, dependency-cruiser, structure whitelist).

---

## Process

### 1. Codebase mapping and structure

- **Tracked files:** Run `git ls-files` (large repos: in PowerShell use `git ls-files | Select-Object -First 150` instead of `head`).
- **Architecture overview:** Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` (folder layout, TanStack Query, layers, path aliases).
- **Doc index:** Read `documentation/DOC_INDEX.md` (SSOT map, quick links).
- **Features (discover, do not assume):** List `src/features/` — this boilerplate ships with **`auth`** and **`setup`** only; forks may add more. Do not use a fixed feature list from another repo.
- **Entry points:** Read `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` (provider order: `QueryProvider` → `AuthProvider` → `BrowserRouter`).

### 2. Governance and rules

- **Rule index:** Read `.cursor/rules/INDEX.md`.
- **Architecture SSOT:** Read `.cursor/rules/architecture/RULE.md` (layers, path aliases `@/*`, import direction, structure whitelist).
- **File placement:** Read `.cursor/rules/file-placement/RULE.md` — validation uses **`projectStructure.config.cjs`** (not `.js`).

### 3. Dependencies and boundaries

- **Tech stack and scripts:** Read `package.json`.
- **Module boundaries:** Read `.dependency-cruiser.cjs` (forbidden upward imports, hooks/services/utils rules, warnings on direct service use from components).

### 4. Active project state

- **Recent activity:** `git log -n 10` (full commit messages: subject and body; do not use `--oneline`)
- **Working tree:** `git status -sb` (confirm branch: feature work should not be on `main`; see `.cursor/rules/workflow/RULE.md`)
- **Optional plans:** Scan `documentation/jobs/` for active work (e.g. `documentation/jobs/temp_job_*/`) when relevant.

---

## Output report

Deliver a concise, scannable summary:

### Project overview

- Application type (Vite + React + MUI + Supabase starter).
- Primary libraries (from `package.json`).
- Current version (`package.json` → `version`).

### Architecture

- **Features:** Names under `src/features/` only (verified, not assumed).
- **Layering:** Pages → components → hooks → services → shared; see `ARCHITECTURE.md` and architecture rule.
- **Import boundaries:** Short list of the most relevant `forbidden` rules from `.dependency-cruiser.cjs`.

### Current state

- Branch and cleanliness of working tree.
- Recent commit themes.
- Active plans (`documentation/jobs/` if relevant).

### Actionable insights

- Mismatches vs rules, missing optional docs, or tech debt called out in repo docs.

## Boilerplate-specific notes

- **Downstream forks:** After cloning for a real product, update the “features” section of this report whenever `src/features/` changes; keep `prime` generic.
- **Validation:** References in this file are checked by `pnpm validate:docs` (cursor doc references). Prefer paths that exist in this repository.
