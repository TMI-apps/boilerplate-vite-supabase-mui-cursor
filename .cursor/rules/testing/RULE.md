# Testing Standards

## Purpose

This rule defines testing requirements, patterns, and quality standards for ensuring code reliability.

## Test Authority — a failing test is a claim, not ground truth

A failing test proves only that code and test disagree. Decide which one is wrong **before** touching production code.

- **Ground-truth hierarchy** (higher wins): user-verified behavior > shipped sibling implementation > official docs > freshly written test.
- **Explicit verdict first:** state "code is wrong because X" or "test is wrong because Y" — with a cited ground-truth source — before any fix.
- **Never** trust a test written in the same session over user-verified behavior.
- **Red-flag loop detector:** swapping implementation approach twice for the same failing test → suspect the test.
- **Expected values** in tests must derive from the shipped SSOT implementation or data, never from an independent re-derivation.

## Local test authority (commit vs merge)

| Layer | Command | Authority |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Preview | `pnpm test:staged` | Dry-run only — shows mode + paths; does not run tests |
| Live (no commit) | `pnpm test:staged:live` | Same runner as pre-commit hook |
| Commit | pre-commit related/full/node-scripts-only | Fast feedback; **not** merge-safe |
| Merge | CI `test` job (`test:classify` + `test:run` + `type-check`) | **Authoritative** |
| Local CI parity | `pnpm test:classify && pnpm test:run` | Before validate / large PRs |
| Force full locally | `PRECOMMIT_TEST_FULL=1` | Escape hatch |

SSOT: `documentation/DOC_AGENT_WORKFLOW_LAYERS.md` § Local git; classifier `scripts/change-classify.cjs`; executor `scripts/test-staged.cjs`.

## Testing documentation SSOT

- **Human + fork onboarding:** `documentation/DOC_TESTING.md` — runners, placement, naming, examples, checklist.
- **This rule:** test authority philosophy, commit vs merge tiers, coverage expectations, Edge Functions policy.

## Runner selection

- **`src/**` and `tests/**` (Vitest):** `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx` — `pnpm test:run`.
- **`scripts/*.test.cjs` (Node `node:test`):** `pnpm test:classify` only; excluded from Vitest.
- Full tree and examples: `documentation/DOC_TESTING.md` § Runner decision tree.

## When to use TDD

This repo is **not** test-first by default. Default: add meaningful automated tests **alongside** implementation when the plan or § What to Test applies.

**Use TDD (red → green → refactor)** when:

- Pure functions, parsers, classifiers, or algorithms with clear inputs/outputs
- Tooling under `scripts/` with deterministic behavior
- Regression-prone logic where expected output is known from specs, fixtures, or shipped sibling code

**Do not default to TDD** when:

- UI flows, MUI components, or layout (manual/browser validation is default — `workflow/RULE.md`)
- Supabase RLS, auth, or Edge Functions (see § Edge Functions Testing — manual)
- The spec is still ambiguous — resolve with user verification first (`.agents/skills/feature/SKILL.md`)

Even in TDD, § Test Authority applies: expected values must trace to a cited ground-truth source, not an ad-hoc re-derivation.

Cross-link: `workflow/RULE.md` § During Development.

## Test Coverage

### Minimum Requirements
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage on critical paths
- Test all public APIs and exported functions
- Cover edge cases and error conditions

### What to Test
- Business logic and calculations
- User interactions and workflows
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points between modules

### What Not to Test
- Third-party library functionality
- Trivial getters/setters without logic
- Implementation details (test behavior, not implementation)

## Test Organization

### File Structure
- **Colocate** unit tests beside source: `Module.ts` → `Module.test.ts` (or `.test.tsx`) in the same folder.
- **`tests/` folder** — shared setup only: `setup.ts`, `test-utils.tsx`, future `integration/` and `e2e/`; not a mirrored copy of `src/`.
- Use descriptive test file names: `[component].test.ts` or `[component].spec.ts`.
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks.

### Test Naming
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested.
- **Mandatory pattern:** `"should [expected behavior] when [condition]"` for Vitest `it()` names.
- `scripts/*.test.cjs` may use `test()` but the quoted name follows the same pattern.
- Avoid generic names like "test1" or "works".

### Shared utilities
- Import from `tests/test-utils` (Vitest alias): `renderWithProviders`, `renderHookWithProviders`, `createDefaultAuthContextValue`.
- See `documentation/DOC_TESTING.md` § Shared utilities.

## Testing Patterns

### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions/components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs, spies) appropriately

### Integration Tests
- Test interactions between modules
- Use real implementations where possible
- Test data flow through the system

### Test Data
- Use factories or builders for test data
- Keep test data minimal and focused
- Avoid hardcoded values that may change

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example

```typescript
describe("calculateTotalPrice", () => {
  it("should return price with tax when given valid inputs", () => {
    const result = calculateTotalPrice(100, 0.20);
    expect(result).toBe(120);
  });
  
  it("should throw error when price is negative", () => {
    expect(() => calculateTotalPrice(-10, 0.20)).toThrow(
      "Price cannot be negative"
    );
  });
  
  it("should handle zero tax rate", () => {
    const result = calculateTotalPrice(100, 0);
    expect(result).toBe(100);
  });
});
```

### ❌ Bad Example

```typescript
// Bad: unclear test names, no edge cases, poor organization
describe("test", () => {
  it("works", () => {
    expect(calculateTotalPrice(100, 0.20)).toBe(120);
  });
});
```

## Test Quality

### Readability
- Tests should read like documentation
- Use clear setup, execution, and assertion phases
- Avoid complex test logic

### Maintainability
- Keep tests independent (no shared state)
- Use beforeEach/afterEach for common setup
- Refactor test code like production code

### Performance
- Keep tests fast (unit tests should run in milliseconds)
- Use appropriate test types for different scenarios
- Avoid unnecessary async operations

## Edge Functions Testing

### Special Considerations

**Edge Functions have unique testing constraints** (branch model SSOT: `.cursor/rules/workflow/RULE.md` § Branch Strategy):

- **No staging environment**: Edge Functions deploy once and affect both develop and main branches
- **Manual testing only**: No automated testing or rollback for functions
- **High impact**: Bugs in Edge Functions impact the entire app across all branches
- **Deployment**: Deploy via `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`

**Testing Strategy:**

- Consider impact before adding new functions
- Test thoroughly in development before deployment
- Use manual testing workflows
- Document test procedures for each function
- Include explicit release validation before **Promote to production** when Edge Function behavior changed

**Frontend Logic Testing** (preferred when possible):

- Test on develop branch first
- User testing before promoting to production
- Easy rollback if issues found
- Better isolation and testability

### Release Validation Gate

Before **Promote to production**, verify:
- Required CI checks are green
- Manual happy-path and key error-path tests are completed
- Any Edge Function-related behavior in scope has been re-tested against the currently deployed function version

For Edge Functions architecture and when to use them, see `cloud-functions/RULE.md`.
