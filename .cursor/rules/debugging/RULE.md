# Debugging and Logging

## Purpose

This rule defines debugging strategies, logging practices, and issue analysis patterns for effective problem-solving.

## Logs

- Do not remove debugging logs until the user confirms they are no longer needed.
- Logs must pass lint.
- For production builds, prefer:
  - A small logger or condition like:
    - `if (import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_API) { console.log(...) }`
  - So logs can be disabled in production.

## API Troubleshooting

- For request errors:
  - Log the request configuration before sending:
    - Method
    - URL
    - Query params
    - Headers (excluding auth)
    - Body (redacted when needed)
- For data processing issues:
  - Log the full raw response object, with tokens and obvious PII redacted.
- Ask the user to provide these logs during debugging.

## Filtering and Pagination

- If API responses always contain a round number of records (25, 50, 100, …) regardless of filters:
  - Suspect pagination limits first.
  - Only then dig into filter logic.

## Debugging Strategy

### Reductive Strategy (Bugs and New Features)

**SSOT:** `.cursor/rules/workflow/RULE.md` § Reductive Strategy — apply that guidance here. Prefer removing or simplifying before adding code.

### Scope Reduction

- Reduce scope when something fails:
  - Start from the smallest testable piece (function, hook, component, API call).
  - Avoid changing multiple layers at once.

### Test Planning

- For every test you introduce (unit test, manual step, or log-based check), think ahead:
  - Define what you will conclude if the test fails.
  - Define what you will conclude if the test succeeds.
  - Define the next step for each outcome before you run the test.

### User Testing Instructions

**When instructing the user to test something:**

- **ALWAYS provide explicit next steps for BOTH success AND failure scenarios.**
- Format: "If SUCCESS → do X" and "If FAILURE → do Y"
- Never leave the user without a clear path forward for either outcome.
- Include what to check, what to report, or what to try next for each case.

## Scientific Method Debugging

**Procedure SSOT:** `.agents/skills/debug/SKILL.md` — run that skill for incidents (event chains, hypotheses, unified steps, iterative narrowing). **Never claim the issue is fixed; only the user decides.**

**Pre-registered hypothesis loop (optional):** `.agents/skills/hypothesis/SKILL.md` — when naive fixes failed or the user invokes hypothesis mode. Router tiebreak: `.agents/skills/router/SKILL.md` (runtime incident → `debug`; pre-registered experiment loop → `hypothesis`).

**Pattern library SSOT:** `.agents/skills/debug/patterns.md` — updated from `finish` or `learn` when a reusable bug class is proved.

Do not duplicate the full scientific-method checklist in this rule. This file owns **logging**, **API troubleshooting**, **scope reduction**, and **user test instructions** above.
